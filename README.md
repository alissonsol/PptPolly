# PptPolly - Add voice to a PowerPoint presentation

Yet another spare time piece of code to automate things I do...

## Instructions

- Get code
- Download and install [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) Edition.
- Follow instructions to [Configure a computer to develop Office solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/vsto/configuring-a-computer-to-develop-office-solutions).

There are now two versions.

- The code under the [AmazonPolly](./AmazonPolly/) folder will make the text to speech conversion using [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/)
- The code under the [PptTextToSpeechAzure](./PptTextToSpeechAzure/) folder will make the text to speech conversion using [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/#features)

Both projects require the Visual Studio Community version and other downloads.
